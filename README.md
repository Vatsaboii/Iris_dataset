Welcome to the Iris Dataset Classification Model repository! This project aims to explore the well-known Iris dataset and develop a classification model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. The Iris dataset is a classic benchmark in machine learning and data analysis, making it an ideal case study for both beginners and experienced practitioners.
In this project, we perform an in-depth exploration of the Iris dataset to understand its characteristics and relationships between features. We then build a machine learning algorithm to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.
